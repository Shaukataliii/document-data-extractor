# 📄 Document Data Extractor  
**AI-Powered Automation for Efficient, Private, and Accurate Document Auditing**

> _“This solution didn’t just save my client hours—it gave them back control over an essential but exhausting task.”_



## 🧠 The Business Problem

In the final phases of construction projects, commissioning engineers face a high-stakes, high-pressure task: auditing hundreds—sometimes thousands—of PDF documents to extract specific data for compliance and reporting.

These documents often include both printed and handwritten notes. Manually reviewing them is time-consuming, prone to error, and frustratingly inefficient—especially when deadlines loom. For one client, this process had become a bottleneck that drained engineering hours and delayed project closeout.



## 💡 My Solution

I built and deployed an **end-to-end AI automation system** to handle this exact challenge.

This system ingests PDF documents, intelligently detects and extracts printed text via OCR, and accurately identifies **handwritten content** using OpenAI’s cutting-edge GPT-4o model. 

To optimize for both **cost and data privacy**, each document image is preprocessed and **strategically cropped** before being sent to the OpenAI API. The extracted information is automatically populated into structured Excel sheets—ready for auditing and compliance checks.



## 🚀 What Changed

Before this tool:
- Engineers were manually reviewing PDFs, checking, and then copying and pasting values line by line.
- The process was taking **several hours** of tedious effort.

After:
- **$5 saved per 1,000 PDFs** by minimizing API usage.
- **50–60x faster document audits**, freeing engineers to focus on value-added tasks.
- Enhanced **privacy** through on-device image processing and selective data sharing.
- Boosted **confidence** in audit accuracy—printed or handwritten.



## 🛠️ My Role

I built this solution from scratch during a freelance engagement. That included:
- Researching the best balance of **accuracy, privacy, and cost**
- Choosing GPT-4o specifically for its **handwriting performance**
- Designing a scalable, scriptable Python-based workflow
- Handling deployment and user handover with clear documentation



## 🔍 Why This Matters

This isn’t just an AI experiment—it’s a business-ready solution to a costly, time-intensive process. If your team deals with **document-heavy operations**—whether in construction, logistics, healthcare, or compliance—this approach can deliver real savings, better focus, and cleaner data.



## 🤝 Let’s Talk
